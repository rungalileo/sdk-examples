## Chief Complaint
No active complaints documented at time of final hospitalization.  
Final medical event: severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) following motor vehicle collision.  

---

## History of Present Illness (HPI)
Dr. Shepherd was involved in a high-speed car accident in 2015. He sustained significant head trauma and other injuries. Despite being conscious at the scene and initially assisting other victims, his own injuries rapidly worsened. He was transported to a local hospital without a Level I trauma center. Delay in proper neurosurgical intervention led to brain death.

## Past Medical History
- **Gunshot wound (shoulder)** – sustained during a hostage situation at Seattle Grace Hospital. Fully recovered.  
- **Hand injury** – loss of fine motor control after a plane crash; temporary impairment, recovered after surgery and rehab.  
- **Chronic stress and insomnia** – secondary to occupational strain.  
- **No chronic conditions** documented (no diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease).  

---

## Surgical History
- Orthopedic repair of hand injury following plane crash (2012).  
- Minor wound management for gunshot injury.  
- No major elective surgeries.  

---

## Medications
- None documented for chronic use.  
- Occasional post-operative pain management (NSAIDs, opioids short-term).  

---

## Allergies
- No known drug allergies (NKDA).  

---

## Family History
- Mother: deceased.  
- Father: deceased, history of abusive behavior.

---

## Review of Systems
- **Neurological:** Prior transient hand motor deficits.  
- **Musculoskeletal:** Prior plane crash injuries, resolved.  
- **Psychiatric:** No formal diagnosis, though high occupational stress.  
- **Other systems:** Non-contributory.  

---

## Physical Exam (Final Admission)
- **General:** Male, middle-aged, unconscious post-trauma.  
- **Neuro:** Glasgow Coma Scale 3 upon deterioration; CT revealed severe brain swelling.  
- **Respiratory/Cardiac:** Initially stable, deteriorated rapidly.  
- **Extremities:** Multiple superficial injuries, none life-threatening.  

---

## Assessment
1. Severe traumatic brain injury with herniation.  
2. Status post motor vehicle collision.  
3. Past history of orthopedic and neurological injuries (resolved).  

---

## Plan
- Emergent neurosurgical evaluation was indicated but delayed.  
- Intubation and mechanical ventilation initiated.  
- Supportive care provided until declaration of brain death.  
- Organs donated per patient’s wishes.

**Physician’s Note:**  
Dr. Derek Shepherd’s death underscores the importance of timely trauma protocols and neurosurgical intervention in TBI cases. Despite a history of resilience through multiple traumatic injuries, the final event was unsurvivable due to systemic delays in care.
