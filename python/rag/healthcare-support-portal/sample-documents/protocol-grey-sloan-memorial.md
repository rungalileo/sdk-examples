# Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital  
**Protocol for Handling Overdramatized Events and One-in-a-Million Scenarios**  
**Version:** Drama Level 3000  

---

## Purpose
To provide clinicians, interns, and star-crossed lovers working at Grey Sloan Memorial with a standardized approach to handling medical events that statistically should *never* happen twice but, somehow, occur every other Thursday.  

---

## Scope
This protocol applies to:  
- Attending surgeons, especially those in complicated love triangles.  
- Surgical interns with suspiciously perfect hair.  
- Patients who arrive in the ER with only minutes to live but a full backstory montage ready.  

---

## Definitions
- **ODME (Overly Dramatized Medical Event):** A scenario where clinical probability is ignored in favor of maximum emotional payoff.  
- **1IAM (One-in-a-Million):** Medical occurrences that, by actuarial tables, should happen once per century but are standard issue at Grey Sloan.  
- **LVAD Wire Incident:** The gold standard of ethically dubious, emotionally charged, plot-driven medical choices.  

---

## Standard Protocol

### 1. Initial Response
- All staff must immediately drop whatever ordinary case they are working on (appendectomies can wait).  
- Cue a tense music swell.  
- Ensure at least one attending is both personally invested and professionally conflicted.  

### 2. Triage of Overdramatized Events
- **Meteor strikes:** Assess emotional fallout before physical injuries.  
- **Plane crashes:** Assign each attending one existential crisis per patient.  
- **Pregnant woman with simultaneous amnesia and rare tumor:** Page neuro, OB, and whichever resident is due for character growth.  

### 3. The LVAD Wire Rule
- Cutting an LVAD wire is **never** recommended… unless it advances the love plot.  
- If performed:  
  - Ensure it’s done under dim lighting with maximum tears.  
  - Documentation should read: “Performed for narrative necessity.”  

### 4. One-in-a-Million Event Handling
- Treat as if it’s the fiftieth time this month (because it probably is).  
- Assign at least one intern to freeze mid-surgery due to trauma flashbacks.  
- Remind everyone: Grey Sloan has no risk management department; only brooding in stairwells.  

### 5. Post-Event Debrief
- Mandatory rooftop scene.  
- Minimum of three speeches containing the words *miracle*, *fate*, or *second chances*.  
- At least one character must dramatically resign but return two episodes later.

## Exception Handling
- If multiple ODME events occur simultaneously (e.g., ferry crash + bomb in chest cavity), prioritize whichever involves more attractive guest stars.  

---

## Closing Statement
This protocol is designed not to save lives but to maximize Nielsen ratings and generate enough tears for at least one Emmy reel.
