## Chief Complaint
Chronic leg pain and mobility impairment due to an infarction in the right quadriceps muscle following a misdiagnosed aneurysm.

---

## History of Present Illness (HPI)
Dr. House experienced an infarction in his right thigh muscle approximately 20 years ago. Initial symptoms included severe pain and muscle necrosis, leading to partial removal of quadriceps muscle tissue. Since then, he has had chronic pain requiring long-term pain management. The condition has contributed to a dependence on a cane for mobility.
