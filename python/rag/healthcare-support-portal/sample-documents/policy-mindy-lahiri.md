## Introduction
Hi! I’m Dr. Mindy Lahiri, OB/GYN, lover of rom-coms, fashion, and being slightly extra.  
This medical policy handbook outlines how I practice medicine, keep patients safe, and stay fabulous at the same time.

## Philosophy of Care
1. **Patient-Centered, Always:** Patients deserve respect, honesty, and a little charm.  
2. **Evidence-Based Medicine:** Science comes first (even if rom-com logic *sometimes* sneaks in).  
3. **Holistic Health:** Emotional wellbeing is just as important as physical health.  
4. **Boundaries:** No, I will not be your therapist. Unless you want to talk about your crush, then maybe.

## Clinical Guidelines

### 1. Preventive Care
- Annual well-woman exams.  
- Pap smears per ACOG guidelines.  
- HPV vaccination strongly encouraged.  
- Discussion of diet, exercise, and self-care routines (including *The Bachelor* if relevant).  

### 2. Prenatal & Obstetric Care
- **Initial visit:** Comprehensive history, labs, ultrasound confirmation.  
- **Follow-up:** Regular monitoring every 4 weeks until 28 weeks, every 2 weeks until 36, then weekly until delivery.  
- **Labor & Delivery:** Respect for birth plans, but safety > Pinterest aesthetics.  
- **Postpartum:** Mental health screening mandatory.  

### 3. Gynecological Care
- Contraceptive counseling: full spectrum, judgment-free.  
- Menstrual concerns: individualized treatment (from birth control to surgery).  
- Fertility consultations offered; referrals as needed.

## Office Policies

### Appointments
- Show up on time. I will try my best to also show up on time… emphasis on *try*.  
- Cancellations require 24-hour notice. Emergencies and celebrity sightings excused.  

### Communication
- Secure messaging through clinic portal encouraged.  
- Texting me about medical results: **not allowed.**  
- Texting me about where to get the best cronuts: allowed.  

### Billing & Insurance
- Standard medical billing applies.  
- Payment plans available.  
- I accept Venmo for coffee bribes, but not for surgery.

## Code of Conduct
- Respect staff and other patients.  
- No “WebMD diagnosing” in the exam room — that’s *my* job.  
- Compliments on my outfit are always welcome but not required.  

---

## Emergency Protocols
- For emergencies: Call 911 or proceed to the nearest ER.  
- After-hours calls are triaged through the on-call service.  
- Do not DM me on Instagram for a medical emergency.

## Closing Statement
This policy is designed to provide clarity, care, and maybe a little humor. At the end of the day, my patients are my priority — and if we can laugh while staying healthy, that’s the dream.
