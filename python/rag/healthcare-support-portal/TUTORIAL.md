---

## Welcome to the Future of Healthcare Knowledge Management

Hi there! 👋 If you're reading this, you're probably curious about AI and how it can transform healthcare information systems. Maybe you've heard buzzwords like "RAG," "vector databases," or "AI embeddings" and wondered what they actually mean in practice. 

Today, we're going to build something truly remarkable together: a complete healthcare knowledge management system that can understand, search, and answer questions about medical documents using artificial intelligence. And the best part? You don't need to be an AI expert to do it.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- 🤖 Your own AI assistant that can answer medical questions
- 🔐 A secure system with role-based access (doctors see different content than nurses)
- 📊 Monitoring dashboards to track AI performance
- 💡 A deep understanding of how modern AI systems work

**Time commitment:** About 2-3 hours (including learning time)  
**Difficulty:** Beginner-friendly with detailed explanations  
**What you'll learn:** RAG systems, vector databases, authorization, AI monitoring

## Chapter 1: Understanding What We're Building

Before we dive into code, let's understand the problem we're solving and why it matters.

### The Healthcare Information Challenge

Imagine you're a doctor in the middle of a busy shift. A patient presents with unusual symptoms, and you need to quickly reference the latest treatment guidelines. Today, you might:

1. 🔍 Search through hundreds of PDF guidelines
2. 📚 Try to remember protocols from medical school
3. 📱 Google symptoms and hope for reliable sources
4. 🕒 Spend precious time that could be helping patients

**What if there was a better way?**

### Enter RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG sounds complicated, but the concept is beautifully simple:

**Traditional AI:** "What's the treatment for pneumonia?"  
**AI Response:** *Generic answer based on training data, no sources, might be outdated*

**RAG-powered AI:** "What's the treatment for pneumonia?"  
**Step 1:** Search your uploaded medical guidelines for relevant information  
**Step 2:** Feed that specific, current information to the AI  
**AI Response:** *Detailed answer based on YOUR documents, with exact page references*

It's like having a research assistant that instantly reads through all your documents and provides sourced answers. That's the magic we're building today.

### The Three Pillars of Our System

Our healthcare knowledge system stands on three technologies:

1. **🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - The AI that understands and answers questions
2. **🔐 Oso** - Security system that ensures doctors only see cardiology docs, nurses see procedures, etc.
3. **📊 Galileo** - Monitoring that tells us how well our AI is performing

Think of it like a hospital:
- **RAG** is the brilliant doctor who knows everything
- **Oso** is the security system that controls who can access what
- **Galileo** is the quality assurance team tracking performance

---

## Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Development Environment

Let's get your computer ready to build AI systems. Don't worry if this feels overwhelming - I'll explain each step.

### What We Need and Why

```bash
# Let's check what you already have
echo "🔍 Checking your system..."
python3 --version    # We need Python for AI processing
node --version       # We need Node.js for our web interface  
docker --version     # We need Docker for our database
git --version        # We need Git to get the code
```

**Why these tools?**
- **Python 3.11+**: The language of AI - most AI libraries are built for Python
- **Node.js 20.19.0+**: For our modern web interface where users will interact with the AI
- **Docker**: To run PostgreSQL with vector search capabilities
- **Git**: To download our pre-built application code

If any of these commands fail, here's what to do:

#### Installing Missing Tools

**Python Missing?**
```bash
# On Mac with Homebrew
brew install python@3.12

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3.12

# On Windows: Download from python.org
```

**Node.js Missing?**
```bash
# Install Node Version Manager (works on Mac/Linux)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

**Docker Missing?**
Visit [docker.com](https://docker.com) and download Docker Desktop for your operating system.

### Installing Our Secret Weapon: UV

Now here's where things get exciting. We're going to use a tool called `uv` - think of it as a supercharged package manager for Python that's incredibly fast.

```bash
# Install uv (the fastest Python package manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Restart your terminal or run:
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc on Mac

# Verify it worked
uv --version
```

**Why UV?** Traditional Python package management can be slow and error-prone. UV solves this by being 10-100x faster and more reliable. It's like upgrading from a bicycle to a sports car.

---

## Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands on the Code

Time to download our healthcare RAG application!

```bash
# Clone the repository (this downloads all the code)
git clone https://github.com/rungalileo/sdk-examples.git
cd sdk-examples/python/rag/healthcare-support-portal

# Take a moment to look around
ls -la
```

**What you're seeing:**
- `packages/` - Our Python microservices (auth, patient management, RAG)
- `frontend/` - The React web application
- `setup.sh` - Automated setup script that does the heavy lifting
- `README.md` - The comprehensive guide we just improved

### The Magic Setup Script

Instead of manually configuring dozens of settings, we have a script that does it all:

```bash
# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Watch the magic happen! The script is:**
1. ✅ Installing Python dependencies with UV (much faster than pip)
2. ✅ Installing JavaScript dependencies for our web interface
3. ✅ Creating configuration files for each service
4. ✅ Generating secure encryption keys
5. ✅ Setting up the database structure

You'll see output like:
```
🏥 Healthcare Support Portal - Initial Setup
=============================================
📁 Creating directories...
🔍 Checking prerequisites...
✅ Python 3.12.1 is compatible
✅ uv package manager found
🐍 Setting up Python environment...
✅ Python dependencies synced
📋 Setting up environment files...
✅ Created packages/auth/.env from example
✅ Created packages/patient/.env from example
✅ Created packages/rag/.env from example
```

If everything goes well, you'll see: **✅ Setup complete!**

---

## Chapter 4: The Most Important Step - Your OpenAI API Key

Here's where the AI magic begins. We need to connect our system to OpenAI's powerful language models.

### Getting Your API Key

1. **Visit [OpenAI's Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)**
2. **Sign up** if you don't have an account (you'll get free credits!)
3. **Create a new API key** - it will look like `sk-abcd1234...`
4. **Copy it** - you'll only see it once!

### Configuring the RAG Service

```bash
# Open the RAG service configuration
nano packages/rag/.env
# Or if you prefer: code packages/rag/.env
```

**Find this line:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Replace it with your actual key:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-abcd1234your-real-key-here
```

### Understanding the Cost

**"Wait, will this cost me money?"**

For testing and learning, costs are minimal:
- **Text embeddings**: ~$0.10 per 1,000 pages of documents
- **AI responses**: ~$0.002 per question answered
- **Your free credits**: Usually $5-18 for new accounts

Translation: You can process hundreds of documents and ask thousands of questions for just a few dollars.

### Testing Your Configuration

```bash
# Let's make sure everything is configured correctly
cd packages/rag
uv run python -c "
import os
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY', '')
if api_key.startswith('sk-'):
    print('✅ API key configured correctly!')
else:
    print('❌ API key missing or invalid')
"
```

```

### Test Galileo Connection

```bash
cd packages/rag
uv run python test_config.py
```

**If Galileo is working, you'll see:**
```
✅ Galileo connection successful
✅ Project 'my-healthcare-rag' configured
```

**If you skip Galileo (totally fine!):**
```bash
# Disable Galileo monitoring
echo "GALILEO_ENABLED=false" >> packages/rag/.env
```

## Chapter 6: Launch Day - Starting Your AI System

This is it! Time to bring your healthcare AI system to life.

```bash
# Start all services (this is the moment of truth!)
./run_all.sh
```

**What's happening behind the scenes:**

1. 🗄️ **PostgreSQL Database** starts up with vector search capabilities
2. ⚖️ **Oso Authorization Server** starts managing permissions
3. 🔐 **Auth Service** starts handling user logins
4. 🏥 **Patient Service** starts managing medical records
5. 🤖 **RAG Service** starts processing documents and AI queries
6. 🌐 **Frontend Web App** starts serving the user interface

**Success looks like:**
```
✅ PostgreSQL Database (Port 5432)
✅ Oso Dev Server (Port 8080)
✅ Auth Service (Port 8001)
✅ Patient Service (Port 8002)
✅ RAG Service (Port 8003)
✅ Frontend Service (Port 3000)

🌐 Frontend: http://localhost:3000
```

### Your First Look at the System

Open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:3000**

**What you're seeing:**
- A modern, clean interface designed for healthcare professionals
- Login form with role-based access
- Document upload area
- AI chat interface

---

## Chapter 7: Meeting Your AI - First Interactions

Let's create some demo users and start experimenting!

### Creating Demo Users

```bash
# This creates realistic healthcare user accounts
uv run python -m common.seed_data
```

**You now have three types of users:**
- **Dr. Smith** (`dr_smith@hospital.com` / `secure_password`) - Cardiologist
- **Nurse Johnson** (`nurse_johnson@hospital.com` / `secure_password`) - Emergency Department
- **Admin Wilson** (`admin_wilson@hospital.com` / `secure_password`) - Hospital Administrator

### Your First Login

1. **Go to http://localhost:3000**
2. **Login as Dr. Smith**: `dr_smith@hospital.com` / `secure_password`
3. **Look around the interface** - notice how it's tailored for medical professionals

### Understanding the AI's Brain - Document Processing

Before our AI can answer questions, it needs to "read" and "understand" documents. Here's how:

#### Step 1: Upload Your First Document

**Find a medical document** (PDF format works best):
- Research paper from PubMed
- Clinical guidelines
- Hospital protocols
- Even this tutorial as a test!

**Upload process:**
1. Click "Upload Document"
2. Select your PDF
3. Add a descriptive title
4. Choose appropriate department/category
5. Click "Upload"

#### Step 2: Watch the AI Process It

Behind the scenes, something amazing is happening:

1. **Text Extraction**: The system reads every word from your PDF
2. **Chunking**: Breaks the document into manageable sections
3. **Embedding Generation**: OpenAI converts each section into a "vector" (mathematical representation of meaning)
4. **Vector Storage**: These vectors are stored in our PostgreSQL database with pgvector

**This process takes 30-60 seconds per document.**

#### Step 3: Your First AI Question

Once processing is complete, try asking:

**Simple question:** *"What is this document about?"*

**Medical question:** *"What are the key treatment recommendations?"*

**Specific question:** *"What does this say about drug interactions?"*

### Understanding What Just Happened

When you asked a question, here's the AI workflow:

1. **Your question** → **Converted to vector**
2. **Vector search** → **Finds relevant document sections**
3. **Relevant sections** + **Your question** → **Sent to OpenAI**
4. **OpenAI** → **Generates contextualized answer**
5. **Answer with sources** → **Displayed to you**

**This is RAG in action!** The AI didn't just guess - it actually "read" your documents and provided a sourced answer.

## Chapter 8: Exploring Role-Based Security

One of the most important features for healthcare is security. Let's explore how Oso manages access control.

### The Security Challenge in Healthcare

In a real hospital:
- Cardiologists shouldn't access psychiatric patient records
- Nurses need procedure documents, not research papers
- Administrators need policy documents, not clinical guidelines
- Everyone needs emergency protocols

### Testing Different User Roles

#### As a Doctor (Current login):
```
✅ Can upload clinical research
✅ Can access treatment guidelines  
✅ Can ask complex medical questions
❌ Cannot access administrative policies (unless relevant)
```

#### Switch to Nurse Johnson:
1. **Logout** and **login as**: `nurse_johnson@hospital.com` / `secure_password`
2. **Upload a nursing procedure** document
3. **Ask**: *"What's the protocol for medication administration?"*

#### Notice the differences:
- Different documents appear
- AI responses are tailored to nursing context
- Access patterns follow role-based permissions

#### Switch to Admin Wilson:
1. **Login as**: `admin_wilson@hospital.com` / `secure_password`  
2. **Upload a hospital policy** document
3. **Ask**: *"What are our HIPAA compliance requirements?"*

### Behind the Scenes: How Oso Works

```python
# This is what's happening in authorization.polar:
allow(user: User, "read", document: Document) if
    user.department = document.department;

allow(user: User, "read", document: Document) if  
    document.is_public = true;

allow(user: User, "read", document: Document) if
    user.role = "admin";
```

**Translation:** Users can only see documents from their department, public documents, or if they're an admin.

---

## Chapter 9: Advanced AI Interactions

Now that you understand the basics, let's explore advanced capabilities.

### Multi-Document Synthesis

Upload multiple related documents and ask:

*"Compare the treatment approaches mentioned across all uploaded guidelines"*

**The AI will:**
1. Search across ALL your documents
2. Find relevant sections from multiple sources
3. Synthesize information from different documents
4. Provide a comprehensive answer with citations

### Contextual Medical Questions

Try these progressively complex questions:

**Level 1:** *"What medications are mentioned in this document?"*

**Level 2:** *"What are the contraindications for the medications mentioned?"*

**Level 3:** *"For a 65-year-old patient with diabetes and kidney disease, which of these medications would be safest?"*

**Level 4:** *"Create a step-by-step treatment protocol based on these guidelines for elderly diabetic patients"*

### Understanding AI Limitations

**What RAG AI does well:**
✅ Exact information retrieval with sources  
✅ Synthesizing information from multiple documents  
✅ Following document-based protocols  
✅ Providing properly attributed answers  

**What to be cautious about:**
⚠️ AI can only work with documents you've uploaded  
⚠️ Always verify critical medical decisions independently  
⚠️ AI may miss nuances in complex cases  
⚠️ Ensure documents are current and authoritative

## Chapter 12: Troubleshooting Like a Pro

Even the best systems sometimes have hiccups. Here's how to diagnose and fix common issues.

### The Diagnostic Approach

When something goes wrong, follow this systematic approach:

#### Step 1: Check the Basics
```bash
# Are all services running?
./health_check.sh

# Or manually:
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Auth service
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Patient service  
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # RAG service
```

#### Step 2: Check the Logs
```bash
# Look for errors in service logs
tail -50 logs/rag.log | grep -i error
tail -50 logs/auth.log | grep -i error
tail -50 logs/frontend.log | grep -i error
```

#### Step 3: Test Individual Components
```bash
# Test OpenAI connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Test database connection  
docker exec healthcare-support-portal-postgres-1 pg_isready

# Test document processing
cd packages/rag
uv run python -c "from src.rag_service.utils.embeddings import test_embeddings; test_embeddings()"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Port Already in Use" Error
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8003

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual number)
kill -9 [PID]

# Or kill all related processes
./stop_all.sh
```

#### "OpenAI API Error" 
```bash
# Check your API key format
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY | grep "sk-"

# Check your account has credits
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  https://api.openai.com/v1/usage
```

#### "Galileo Span Error"
This error is non-fatal but annoying:
```bash
# Option 1: Disable Galileo
echo "GALILEO_ENABLED=false" >> packages/rag/.env

# Option 2: Fix Galileo configuration
echo "GALILEO_API_KEY=your-real-key" >> packages/rag/.env
```

#### Documents Not Processing
```bash
# Check document upload status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8003/api/v1/documents/

# Manually trigger embedding generation
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8003/api/v1/documents/1/regenerate-embeddings
```

### When All Else Fails: Fresh Start
```bash
# Nuclear option - complete reset
./stop_all.sh
docker-compose down --volumes
rm -rf logs/* data/postgres/* packages/*/.env
./setup.sh
```
