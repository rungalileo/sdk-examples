# Log MCP calls as tool spans

This is an example project demonstrating how to use Galileo to log MCP server calls as tool spans. This code is described in the [Log MCP Server Tool Calls how-to guide](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/how-to-guides/basics/log-mcp-server-calls/log-mcp-server-calls) in the Galileo documentation.

The MCP server used by default is the [Galileo MCP server](https://v2docs.galileo.ai/getting-started/mcp/setup-galileo-mcp), but you can use this code with any MCP server that supports a streamable HTTP connection by changing the `MCP_SERVER_URL` environment variable.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.9 or later installed. You can then install the required dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will also need an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).

## Configure environment variables

You will need to configure environment variables to use this project. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then update the environment variables in the `.env` file with your Anthropic and Galileo values:

```ini
# Your Galileo API key
GALILEO_API_KEY="your-galileo-api-key"

# Your Galileo project name
GALILEO_PROJECT="your-galileo-project-name"

# The name of the Log stream you want to use for logging
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM="your-galileo-log-stream"

# Provide the console url below if you are using a
# custom deployment, and not using the free tier, or app.galileo.ai.
# This will look something like “console.galileo.yourcompany.com”.
# GALILEO_CONSOLE_URL="your-galileo-console-url"

# # The URL of the MCP server you are connecting to
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://api.galileo.ai/mcp/http/mcp

# Anthropic properties
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# The Anthropic model you are using
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the example application:

```bash
python app.py
```

You will see a list of the tools available on the MCP server. You can then ask questions against that server:

```output
Connected to server with tools: ['integrate_galileo_with_langchain', 'integrate_galileo_with_openai', 'get_logstream_insights', 'validate_dataset', 'create_galileo_dataset', 'create_prompt_template', 'setup_galileo_experiment', 'search_docs']

Query: How do I use the GalileoLogger?

I'll search the Galileo documentation to find information about how to use the GalileoLogger.

# Using the GalileoLogger

The **GalileoLogger** class provides granular control over logging in Galileo. Here's how to use it:
