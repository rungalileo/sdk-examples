Content credentials and Adobe's approach to responsible AI were recognized by Fast Company as one of the year's breakthrough innovations. We were again named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Glassdoor listed Adobe is one of the best places to work and Interbrand ranked us in the top 20 Best Global Brands as the rising brand for the eighth year in a row.\\nDigital remains a massive tailwind as content demand and consumption continues to grow and businesses of all sizes are focused on transforming their customer experiences.

We'll share additional information on our succession plans for John early next year. I'm sure I speak for all of us when I sincerely thank John for all he's done for Target and wish him only the best in his retirement.\\nWith that, we'll turn to Q&A. Christina, John, Michael and I will be happy to take your questions.\\n\\nCompany Name: Disney | Quarter: Q4 |  to see stability in ad sales despite challenges facing the broader media industry.\\nESPN BET will launch next week through our agreement with Penn Entertainment, and we are excited to bring sports fans this compelling new experience. Regarding our broader linear business, we continue to evaluate options for each of our linear networks with the goal of identifying the best strategic path for the company and maximizing shareholder value. However, our review of the business thus far has uncovered significant long-term cost opportunities, which we're implementing while continuing to deliver high-quality content. Speaking of which, I'd like to acknowledge the world-class journalists and producers at ABC News. Over the past few months, many have risked their lives to keep our audiences informed during relentless news cycles and made ABC number one in network news for the 11th consecutive year. Next is the need to strengthen the creative output of our film studio which generates value throughout the entire company.\\nTo achieve this, we are focusing heavily on the core brands and franchises that fuel all\\n\\nCompany Name: NetApp | Quarter: Q2 |  cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks.\\nOur position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A US-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor's SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer's first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery.\\nLooking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY'24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid\\n\\nCompany Name: Broadcom | Quarter: Q4 |  year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. For the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%.\\nRevenue in fiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year and our expectation for fiscal '24 is for this revenue to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. For the 2024 outlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by doing so, create private clouds on-prem.\\nOur strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across the other data centers as well as on public clouds by consuming VMware's higher-value software stack. And\\n\\nCompany Name: GAP | Quarter: Q3 |  respond in real time to consumer and competitive dynamics, ensuring our brands breakthrough this season with relevant campaigns and touchpoints that matter.\\nWith the progress we achieved in the third quarter, and our measured expectations for the holiday season, we are comfortable reaffirming our full year revenue outlook and expect strong progress in our margin recovery. Katrina will provide more detail on the outlook in a moment.\\nLet's turn to brand reinvigoration. Brand reinvigoration is about driving both relevance and revenue. Now, it's early days, and our playbook is still in development, but I'll give you some insight into how we're thinking and where we're headed brand by brand.\\nOld Navy, Gap, Banana Republic and Athleta are all brands with incredible heritage. Brand reinvigoration will build on that heritage, and will include a number of priorities. We need to strengthen our portfolio of brands with crisp identities and purpose. We need to create trend-right product assortments, with\\n\\nCompany Name: GAP | Quarter: Q3 |  brand.\\nNow, turning to Banana Republic. I am encouraged by the team's vision, aesthetic direction, and enhanced focus on fabrication and quality, and our cashmere and leather product offering is translating well. While this repositioning is the right direction for the brand, there is work to do on execution. Comps are down as we continue to refine our assortment architecture, work on the brand's price value equation, and improve marketing and merchandising effectiveness.\\nWe think Banana Republic has an opportunity to thrive in the quiet luxury space and represents a unique position in our portfolio. This evolution will take time to manifest as we transition away from what was previously a highly promotional and transactional experience.\\nNow, taking a look at Athleta, a brand with significant growth potential, and the number five brand in the highly attractive US women's active segment. More so than any of our other brands, Athleta has a clear and distinctive brand positioning, rooted in the Power of She, an\\n\\nCompany Name: Target | Quarter: Q3 |  backdrop today remains tough, because of the long-term investments we continue to make and the efforts of our team to identify efficiency opportunities throughout our business, we have a lot more opportunity to grow both our top-line and increase our profitability in the years ahead. And our team is already delivering strong profit performance, both compared to a year ago and versus our longer-term history as well.\\nNow, I'll turn to capital deployment and reiterate our priorities which have remained consistent for decades. We first look to fully invest in projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Then, we look to support the dividend and build on our record of annual increases, which we've maintained for more than 50 years. And finally, we deploy any excess cash within the limits of our middle A credit ratings through share repurchase over time.\\nRegarding the first priority, capital investment through the first three quarters of the year was just under $4 billion, and we expect full year capex will be near the high\\n\\nCompany Name: Target | Quarter: Q3 | 's been the most notable. John has served as both a formal and informal mentor to countless members of our team, and he's hired and developed an extraordinary group of leaders, including Mark Schindele in our stores and Gretchen McCarthy in our supply chain, both of whom are ready and well prepared to continue leading the work after John steps down.\\nPerhaps the strongest complement I can pay John is to say he will be missed as a colleague, and I will personally miss his partnership. But I know our operations will not miss a beat, given how masterfully he's prepared everyone around him. And that goes for me too. Since the day I arrived, John has been a trusted adviser, whose only goal was to do what was best for our guests, for this great Company and for our team. I should also reiterate that John will remain in his role through the end of this fiscal year and has agreed to continue in an advisory role until February of 2025. We'll share additional information on\\n\\nCompany Name: eBay | Quarter: Q4 |  up. As part of the smart targeting launch, we've also extended CPC ads to the similar items recommendations module when users are viewing another item, using fully automated targeting and bidding technology.\\nMoving to our third pillar, magical innovations. Last quarter, we discussed our magical listing experience, which represents the biggest transformation of the eBay listing process in our 28-year history. For over two decades, two of our biggest focuses were at odds with each other: making it a simple and fast as possible to list an item and ensuring listings are rich and comprehensive to maximize sales. Now generative AI allows us to leverage our treasure trove of images and listing data to quickly create compelling listings.\\nEarly users have told us these capabilities will unlock more of the inventory in their closets and garages, which could ultimately keep more products out of landfills. The first phase of our magical listing experience leverages generative AI to instantly populate the item description within the listing flow based on a product's title,\\n\\nMake sure to use this context when answering questions.\",\n",
