    1. First, use TodoListTool with operation='get_list' to see current todo status

       - Clarity and readability for C-suite executives
       - Accuracy of information and citations
       - Completeness of coverage
       - Structure and flow
       - Technical depth vs. accessibility balance

    3. For EACH issue/improvement needed, use TodoListTool with operation='add' to create a specific task:
       - title: Clear, actionable improvement (e.g., "Add citation for AGI benchmark claim")
       - description: Detailed explanation of what needs to be done

    4. After adding all improvement tasks, provide assessment:
