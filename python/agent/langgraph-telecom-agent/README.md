# ConnectTel Telecom Multi-Agent System

This is a telecom customer service multi-agent system built with LangGraph and Chainlit. It demonstrates how AI agents can handle various telecom support scenarios including network issues, billing inquiries, technical support, and service management.

## Overview

This app is a customer service chatbot for the fictional telecom provider, **ConnectTel**. The system uses multiple specialized agents to handle different aspects of telecom customer support, all orchestrated by a supervisor agent.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different telecom domains
- **Mock Data System**: No live APIs required - perfect for demos and testing
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Simulates real telecom support interactions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles network, billing, technical, and service issues

## What You Can Do

Ask the bot about:

- ðŸ’° **Billing & Usage**: Review bills, track data usage, understand charges
- ðŸ”§ **Technical Support**: Troubleshoot connectivity issues, configure devices
- ðŸ“Š **Plan Recommendations**: Get personalized plan suggestions based on usage

## System Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **LangGraph**: Agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Chainlit**: User interface for chat interactions
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for knowledge retrieval
- **Galileo**: Monitoring and evaluation platform

### Agents

The system consists of three specialized agents, all coordinated by a supervisor:


#### 1. Billing & Account Agent
Handles all billing-related inquiries, usage tracking, and account management.

**Tools**: `BillingTool`
- Check account balance and due dates
- Track data, voice, and text usage
- Review billing history
- Suggest plan optimizations

#### 2. Technical Support Agent
Provides troubleshooting assistance and device configuration support.

**Tools**: `TechnicalSupportTool`
- Step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Device configuration (APN, WiFi calling)
- Service resets and escalations
- Diagnostic codes

#### 3. Plan Advisor Agent
Analyzes customer needs and recommends suitable plans and services.

**Tools**: `PineconeRetrievalTool`
- Compare plan features
- Identify savings opportunities
- Recommend add-ons and bundles
- Explain plan benefits

## Mock Data System

Since this is a demo system without live telecom APIs, all tools use mock data generators that provide:

- **Realistic Responses**: Coherent, context-aware information
- **Dynamic Values**: Randomized metrics (signal strength, speeds, etc.)
- **Consistent State**: Maintains session context
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Simulates various support situations

### Example Mock Data

- **Customer Accounts**: Multiple customer profiles with different plans
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and solutions
- **Plan Catalog**: Various individual, family, and business plans

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [Pinecone Account](https://www.pinecone.io) (optional)
- [Galileo Account](https://app.galileo.ai/sign-up) (optional for monitoring)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd langgraph-telecom-agent
```

2. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync --dev

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up vector database (optional - only needed for Plan Advisor Agent)**
```bash
# Upload telecom documentation to Pinecone
# This will create a "telecom-plans" index with plan information and troubleshooting guides
python ./scripts/setup_pinecone.py
```

**Note**: The Pinecone setup is only required if you want to use the Plan Advisor Agent with vector search capabilities. The other agents (Network Operations, Billing, Technical Support, SIM Management) work with mock data and don't require Pinecone.

### Running the Application

**Start the Chainlit UI**
```bash
chainlit run app.py -w
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

**Test the tools directly**
```bash
python test_tools.py
```

## Example Interactions

### Billing Inquiry
**User**: "What's my current data usage?"
**Bot**: Shows data consumption, remaining allowance, and average daily usage

### Technical Support
**User**: "My internet is really slow"
**Bot**: Provides troubleshooting steps, checks network congestion, suggests optimizations

### Plan Advice
**User**: "I need a plan with international calling"
**Bot**: Recommends suitable plans with international features, compares options
