# Homework Assignment 2: Recipe Bot Error Analysis

This folder contains a solution to [homework assignment 2](https://github.com/ai-evals-course/recipe-chatbot/tree/main/homeworks/hw2) using Galileo.

## Original homework assignment

The original homework assignment has two parts:

- Generate test queries
- Find and categorize errors

## Using Galileo for this assignment

Galileo has built-in capabilities to perform these tasks, allowing you to save your generated test queries as a dataset, then run this dataset against a simulation of the recipe chatbot (or you could run against the actual recipe bot if required). Once you have generated data using your queries, you can then annotate these to identify failures, then export these annotations to alow you to build a taxonomy of failure modes.

This folder contains a sample notebook showing all these steps in code.
