# AI Evals course homework

This repo contains solutions to the homework assignments from the [AI Evals For Engineers & PMs course on Maven](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals). These solutions use Galileo for running prompts, managing datasets, observing AI applications, and running evals.

The original homework assignments are from the [AI Evals GitHub repo](https://github.com/ai-evals-course/recipe-chatbot/tree/main/homeworks).

## Prerequisites

To run these homework assignments, you will need:

- Python 3.10 or higher installed
- A [Galileo account](https://app.galileo.ai/sign-up). The free tier is plenty for this
- An LLM account. This tutorial assumes you are using OpenAI, but any LLM provider that is supported by Galileo will work.
- The contents of the original [Recipe Chatbot GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ai-evals-course/recipe-chatbot/tree/main)
